# Intro

There are so many plugins on the great [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) page that
it makes sense to filter them out and also to **score** them. The plugins below contain 50 or more commits and are
**evaluated** by an automatic script in order to detect:

- ones with 100 or more commits
- active ones
- very active ones
- maintained ones
- ones having an ongoing research & development

Just take a look at the iconography. It's intuitive and easy to memorize. In minutes you'll be able to grep interesting
plugins with your eyes!
